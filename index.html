    <p>My favourite book is of 'Geronimo Stilton' Geronimo Stilton is an Italian children's book series written by Elisabetta Dami (though the covers claim they were written by the title character).[1] On older novels, the copyright is issued to a pseudonym "Geronimo Stilton"; this was changed on newer books. The books are intended for readers in the 6- to 12-year-old age range.

Scholastic Corporation has published the English version of the series in the US since February 2004, and the books are published by Sweet Cherry Publishing in the UK.

The series has sold over 140 million copies worldwide, and with 249 editions it is one of the best-selling book series ever written.[2] The books have been translated into 38 languages.[3]

In the series, the title character is an anthropomorphic mouse who lives in the fictional New Mouse City on fictional Mouse Island. A best-selling author, Geronimo Stilton[4] works as a journalist and editor for the fictional newspaper The Rodent's Gazette.

He has a younger sister named Thea Stilton,[5] a cousin named Trap Stilton,[5] and a favourite nephew, nine-year-old Benjamin Stilton (Ben).[5] Geronimo is a nervous, mild-mannered mouse who would like nothing better than to live a quiet life, but he keeps getting involved in faraway adventures with Thea, Trap, and Benjamin, and sometimes Aunt Sweetfur. The books are written as though they are autobiographical adventure stories.

Papercutz obtained the rights to publish English translations of the graphic novels of Geronimo Stilton. These retain some of the original names of the characters that were changed in the storybooks translated by Scholastic. For example, the English translations of the graphic novels by Papercutz continue to use the names "Patty Spring" and "Pandora", while the storybooks by Scholastic changed these names to Petunia Pretty Paws and Bugsy Wugsy, respectively.
